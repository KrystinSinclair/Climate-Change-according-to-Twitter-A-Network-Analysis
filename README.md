 The excel files are stored in the data folder and are for global warming and climate change separately. The tweets were streamed using Social Fed Manager from the Gelman Library at The George Washington University. The tweets were streamed fromm 2/15/2019 till 3/7/2019. 
 The R files title Climate Change Script and Global Warming Script are to create the edge and node lists. The R files title Global Warming Network Analysis and Climate Change Network Analysis are to create the networks and plot them. The R files titles Global Warming Unipartite and Climate Change Unipartite are additional analysis. There is also an R Markdown file that runs a Z test on proportions of number of reliable tweets fromm Global Warming andd Climate Change. The data was also imported into GEPHI as this is a tool for user friendly networks. Gephi calculated the weights. The Gephi extract we reimported into R and loglog plots to demonstrate the powerlaw of of social media links were created in another R file titled GephiDegrees.
